  <h2> <em>How to make hamburgers:</em> </h2>
  
  <ul> 
  <p>
  <li>In a deep container, mix the milk with the egg, ketchup, mustard, garlic salt, Proven√ßal herbs and season with salt and pepper to taste. We beat and add the two chopped slices of bread. We mash with a fork so that the bread is well soaked while making a dough as similar as possible to a porridge in which no pieces of bread are noticeable.</li>


  <li>Add the minced meat and, with clean hands, mix until well incorporated . We divide our burger mixture into six equal parts. We take each one of them, ball it and crush it between the palms of our hands. We can use a plating ring or some device to form hamburgers, but it is not necessary.</li>

  <li>Brush a large frying pan or griddle with olive oil and heat it over high heat. We place the hamburgers on it and mark them, without touching or crushing, for two or three minutes, lowering the heat to medium cooking . We turn, cover each burger with two slices of cheese, cover and let it cook on the other side for another two or three minutes. The time will depend on the point we want to give to the meat. We serve immediately.</li>
