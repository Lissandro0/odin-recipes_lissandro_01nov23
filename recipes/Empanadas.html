  <h2> <em>How to make empanadas: </em></h2>
    <ul> 
    <p>
    <li>To prepare the dough: In a container place the pre-cooked corn flour, wheat flour or cornstarch and the salt. Adding the water and mixing until the flour is hydrated, knead well until you obtain a soft and malleable dough, like plasticine. If the dough is too dry, add more water and if it is too runny, add more corn flour. Let the dough rest for about 10 minutes.</li>
    
    <li>Take a portion of the dough and make a ball, place it on the plastic that will have been slightly wet, spread it with your hand or with the help of a plate or board, place a tablespoon of filling in the center and fold it into a half-moon shape, with plastic help.</li>

    <li>You can use a container to shape and cut the empanada, this helps them to be the same size and the edges are well sealed so that the filling does not come out.</li>
    
    <li>They are fried in plenty of hot oil or baked at 400Â°F for approximately 25 minutes.</li>
    
    <li>Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the oil. Serve and enjoy!</li>
